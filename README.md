## 🧑‍💻 About Me

- As a DevOps engineer, I work on reducing costs and improving the structure of existing AWS infrastructure.
- I continuously explore ways to enhance work efficiency through AI, with a strong focus on crafting prompts that minimize hallucinations and improve accuracy.
- I'm constantly sharing my knowledge on my blog, summarising the devops insights and experiences I've learnt in my work. In doing so, I hope to make it easier for those without experience.
